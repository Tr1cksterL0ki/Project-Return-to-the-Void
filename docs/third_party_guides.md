# Third-party guides (what we keep vs reject)

This repo cross-references popular communities and guides, but does **not** endorse everything in them.

## PC-Tuning (valleyofdoom)
Useful for:
- structured Windows configuration checklists
- measurement-first ideas (PresentMon, xperf)
Avoid:
- security regressions (Defender off, blocklist off)
- fragile timer/interrupt hacks without measurement

## Calypto’s latency guide
Good for:
- conceptual framing (latency pipeline)
Risky sections to avoid:
- broad security disable recommendations
- driver/OS tampering steps

## Community threads (Reddit/YouTube)
We treat these as hypotheses until confirmed by:
- official docs
- reputable labs / reproducible measurements
