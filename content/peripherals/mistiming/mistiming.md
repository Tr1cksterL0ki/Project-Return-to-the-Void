# Frame pacing / “mistiming” demos

These slow-motion clips help visualize **cadence mismatch** on fixed-refresh displays.

**Note:** you need a monitor with refresh rates that are multiples of 30 (60/90/120/150/180/210/240/270/300/330/360/390 Hz) to watch these 30 FPS videos without added judder.

Recorded @ 240 FPS, playback @ 30 FPS → 1/8 speed.

- [370 FPS @ 360 Hz](370.mp4)
- [360 FPS @ 360 Hz](360.mp4)

## VALORANT takeaway
For competitive play, prioritize a **cap you can hold with clean 1% lows** over chasing the highest peak FPS.
